# Form Validation with JavaScript
Almost every major site has sign-up forms, contact forms, search forms and more. Therefore, itâ€™s crucial to be able to handle forms.

This project utilized JavaScript, the Constraint Validation API and CSS to style the validations.

I built a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It uses live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.
